          Research experience
        </h3>

        <p className="text-gray-400 text-xl mt-2">
          In my master{"'"}s thesis, I investigated the idea of utilising
          late-stage C-H activation with stable, cost-effective, high-valent
          cobalt-catalysis to synthesise synthetically useful bioactive
          compounds and natural products.
          <br /> <br />
          In my doctoral study I am focusing on the development of new
          methodology for the formation of new C-C and C-N bond. In one part of
          my doctoral study, I am working on carbene transfer reaction and
          applications in cyclopropanation, C-H functionalization, X-H insertion
          and sigmatropic rearrangement reactions. In this context, I studied
          both metal-catalyzed and photochemical, metal- free carbene transfer
          reactions. More recently, I have started working on the timely
          research field of metallaphotoredox and photoredox catalysis for the
          C-C and C-X (X = hetero atom) bond forming reactions. Beside the
          expertise in organic synthesis and catalysis, I also learned and
          performed DFT calculations for a few projects in my PhD.

          Teaching experience
        </h3>

        <p className="text-gray-400 text-xl mt-2">
          Teaching of younger students is an integral task for all PhD students
          in the Koenigs group. During my PhD, I was teaching assistant in
          undergraduate chemistry and medicinal chemistry laboratories, and I
          supervised several research students, MSc thesis, and apprentices in
          laboratory technician education. Many of these co-workers co-authored
          publications with me, which clearly underlines the high value of such
          individualized development plans. This also helps me to build my
          communication skill, leadership ability and of course improve my
          science
